## Bio  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences program at Dartmouth. I'm interested in developing statistical and bioinformatic tools to bridge population health research and genomic assays through novel feature selection and feature engineering. My work mostly focuses on the infant gut microbiome, early life exposures and childhood diseases. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/qpmnguyen), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qpmnguyen/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y5jqD-IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quangpmnguyen).
