## Bio  

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences program at Dartmouth. I'm interested in developing statistical and bioinformatic tools to bridge population health research and high-throughput sequencing assays through novel feature selection and engineering. My work mostly focuses on the infant gut microbiome, early life exposures and childhood diseases. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/qpmnguyen), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qpmnguyen/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y5jqD-IAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quangpmnguyen).
