I'm a data scientist and R/Julia developer in the biomedical sciences. I am currently a Biostatistician at [Regeneron Pharmaceuticals](https://www.regeneron.com/) in early clinical research. Previously, I received my Ph.D. at Dartmouth College working on statistical methods for integrating prior biological knowledge in microbiome data analysis tasks.
