A while ago Dr. Ben Ogorek wrote a Medium/Twitter post titled ["Bayesians also suffer from the multiple looks bias"](https://medium.com/@baogorek/bayesians-also-suffer-multiple-looks-bias-cd23c827edce), which makes the case that Bayesian statisticians can't get [free lunches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch) and skip a whole genre of very old and very common problems in statistical analysis. The post is in itself a response to another blog post from Dr. Frank Harell titled [Continuous Learning from Data: No Multiplicities from Computing and Using Bayesian Posterior Probabilities as often as Desired](https://www.fharrell.com/post/bayes-seq/). Unfortunately, the response from Dr. Harell  was a bit hard to understand especially for a new practicing statistician (like me!).  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I quit reading at &quot;A key difference is that, in my simulation, there is a null hypothesis and it is always true. &quot; Bayesians don&#39;t condition on unknowns and neither do most scientists. The goal of Bayes is to uncover the hidden truth generating the data, whether null or not.</p>&mdash; Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1505982120719798275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As such, this post is my own attempt at deciphering this issue at a level that is more approachable (Disclaimer: I'm Bayesian by aspiration).  

# What is the multiple testing problem?   

# Are Bayesians immune?  

# More simulations
