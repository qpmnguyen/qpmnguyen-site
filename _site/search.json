As an part of the DIFUSE program funded by NSF at Dartmouth College, we built an interactive data visualization and analysis tool based on R Shiny for students to explore the eddy covariance technique. Students are able to view data in raw format, interact with different visualizations, as well as being able to use such data to learn about how carbon exchange differs between seasons and time of day.\nBuilt Using:\nR\nShiny\nplotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicrobesim: An R package for quick simulation of microbiome count data\n\n\n\nSource Code\n\n\n\nIn order to develop and apply data analysis techniques to microbiome relative abundance data, researchers often have to perform numerical simulations that approximate real data.

My current work primarily concerns the microbiome relative abundance data. Specifically, developing methods for:\nIntegrating taxonomy and functional annotation in microbiome-outcome analyses to present a more mechanistic look at the role of the microbiome in infant health.\nLeveraging ecological interactions and microbe-specific features to enhance understanding of the role of individual microbes or microbial guilds in health outcomes.\nUnderstanding microbiome colonization dynamics and how are they impacted by different exposures.\nFirst-author manuscripts\nAssociations between the gut microbiome and the metabolome in early lifeQuang P Nguyen, Margaret R. Karagas, Juliette C. Madan, Erika Dade, Tom J. Palys, Hilary G. Morrison, Wimal W. Pathmasiri, Susan McRitche, Susan J. Sumner, H. Robert Frost, Anne G. Hoen\n[Source Code] [Manuscript]Abstract: The infant intestinal microbiome plays an important role in metabolism and immune development with impacts on lifelong health. The linkage between the taxonomic composition of the microbiome and its metabolic phenotype is undefined and complicated by redundancies in the taxon-function relationships within microbial communities. To inform a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and health, we performed an integrative statistical and machine learning-based analysis of microbe taxonomic structure and metabolic function in order to characterize the taxa-function relationship in early life.\ncILR: Competitive isometric log-ratio for taxonomic enrichment analysisQuang P Nguyen, Anne G. Hoen, H. Robert FrostSubmitted\n[Analysis Code] [Package] [Pre-print]Abstract: High-dimensionality and sparsity are challenging problems in statistical analysis of microbiome relative abundance data. One approach is to aggregate taxa to sets, most commonly to Linnean taxonomic categories identified through classification of representative sequences. However, most researchers perform aggregation through the pairwise summation of counts, preventing comparison across sets of different sizes. We developed a taxa set enrichment method based on the isometric log-ratio transformation (cILR) for microbiome relative abundance data. Our method generates sample-specific taxa set enrichment scores with a well-defined null hypothesis corresponding to the Q2 competitive null hypothesis in the gene set testing literature. Significance testing was performed by estimating the empirical null distribution accounting for variance inflation due to inter-taxa correlation.\nCo-author manuscripts\nJie Zhou, Anne G Hoen, Susan Mcritchie, Wimal Pathmasiri, Weston D Viles, Quang P Nguyen, Juliette C Madan, Erika Dade, Margaret R Karagas, Jiang Gui.
