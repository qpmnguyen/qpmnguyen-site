I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences from Dartmouth College. I have broad interests in data science within the biopharmaceutical research sphere but I am most invested in using genomic technologies for public health purposes.\nEducation\nGeisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College | Lebanon, NH\nPh.D. Candidate in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences | September, 2017 - Expected June, 2022\nBates College | Lewiston, ME\nB.S. in Biochemistry and Mathematics | September, 2013 - June, 2017\nRecent Roles\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals | Biostatistics Intern in early clinical developmentThe COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic | Data Quality and Science Communication\nSkills and Interests\nR for data related work: I am an R programmer for the past 5 years and use it in most of my projects. I mostly use R to perform statistical analysis (e.g. glm, cmdstanr, lme4) in the context of genomic (mostly microbiome) data sets (e.g. phyloseq, dada2, DESeq2). I am proficient in utilizing the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem, have experience developing R packages and Shiny dashboards, and can develop workflows using targets.\nPython for backend analysis and workflow generation: I use python mostly for interacting with biological databases (NCBI, Pathway Tools via biopython), and writing reproducible workflows (using snakemake). I also use python for machine learning coursework and personal projects (pytorch, tensorflow, and scikit-learn).\nJulia and C++ for performance code: I am familiar with using Julia and C++ for writing analyses or algorithms that require performance. This is done either for personal projects or integrated with R (via Rcpp).\nShell/Bash scripting for running command-line tools and utilities.\nGit/GitHub for code versioning and continuous integration.\nSQL (SQLite and MySQL) for creating and accessing data that cannot fit in memory.\nSlurm/Torque High Performance Computing for analyses that require extra memory and computing time.\nAdditional technologies I’m familiar with include: Rust, nextflow\n\n\n\n",

I hope to deploy these tools to help assist in generating meaningful mechanistically driven hypotheses from population-level surveys.\nFirst-author manuscripts\nAssociations between the gut microbiome and the metabolome in early lifeQuang P Nguyen, Margaret R. Karagas, Juliette C. Madan, Erika Dade, Tom J. Palys, Hilary G. Morrison, Wimal W. Pathmasiri, Susan McRitche, Susan J. Sumner, H. Robert Frost, Anne G. Hoen\n[Source Code] [Manuscript]Abstract: The infant intestinal microbiome plays an important role in metabolism and immune development with impacts on lifelong health. The linkage between the taxonomic composition of the microbiome and its metabolic phenotype is undefined and complicated by redundancies in the taxon-function relationships within microbial communities. To inform a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and health, we performed an integrative statistical and machine learning-based analysis of microbe taxonomic structure and metabolic function in order to characterize the taxa-function relationship in early life.\ncILR: Competitive isometric log-ratio for taxonomic enrichment analysisQuang P Nguyen, Anne G. Hoen, H. Robert FrostSubmitted\n[Analysis Code] [Package] [Pre-print]Abstract: High-dimensionality and sparsity are challenging problems in statistical analysis of microbiome relative abundance data. One approach is to aggregate taxa to sets, most commonly to Linnean taxonomic categories identified through classification of representative sequences. However, most researchers perform aggregation through the pairwise summation of counts, preventing comparison across sets of different sizes. We developed a taxa set enrichment method based on the isometric log-ratio transformation (cILR) for microbiome relative abundance data. Our method generates sample-specific taxa set enrichment scores with a well-defined null hypothesis corresponding to the Q2 competitive null hypothesis in the gene set testing literature. Significance testing was performed by estimating the empirical null distribution accounting for variance inflation due to inter-taxa correlation.\nCo-author manuscripts\nRebecca M Lebeaux, Juliette C Madan, Quang P Nguyen, Modupe O Coker, Erika F Dade, Yuka Moroishi, Thomas J Palys, Benjamin D Ross, Melinda M Pettigrew, Hilary G Morrison, Margaret R Karagas, Anne G Hoen.
